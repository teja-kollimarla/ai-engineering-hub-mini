# Hugging Face Skills (with Brightdata support)

This project is an extension of the [Hugging Face Skills](https://github.com/huggingface/skills) project. Hugging Face Skills are definitions for AI/ML tasks like dataset creation, model training, and evaluation. They are interoperable with all major coding agent tools like Claude Code. This repository includes a new skill for Bright Data to interact with the web and perform various tasks.

The Skills in this repository follow the standardized format [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/home) format.

## How do Skills work?

In practice, skills are self-contained folders that package instructions, scripts, and resources together for an AI agent to use on a specific use case. Each folder includes a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name and description) followed by the guidance your coding agent follows while the skill is active.

## Installation

Run the following commands to test it out yourself:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Install skills:
```bash
bash scripts/link-skills.sh
```

3. Run Claude Code:

```bash
claude
```

4. Verify skills:

```bash
/skills
```

### Using skills in your coding agent

Once a skill is installed, mention it directly while giving your coding agent instructions:

- "Use the Bright Data web skill to scrape this website 'https://example.com/'."
- "Use the HF LLM trainer skill to estimate the GPU memory needed for a 70B model run."
- "Use the HF model evaluation skill to launch `run_eval_job.py` on the latest checkpoint."
- "Use the HF dataset creator skill to draft new few-shot classification templates."
- "Use the HF paper publisher skill to index my arXiv paper and link it to my model."

Your coding agent automatically loads the corresponding `SKILL.md` instructions and helper scripts while it completes the task.

### Customize a skill

1. Copy one of the existing skill folders (for example, `hf-datasets/`) and rename it.
2. Update the new folder's `SKILL.md` frontmatter:

   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-skill-name
   description: Describe what the skill does and when to use it
   ---

   # Skill Title

   Guidance + examples + guardrails
   ```

3. Add or edit supporting scripts, templates, and documents referenced by your instructions.
4. Add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with a concise, human-readable description.
5. Run `python scripts/generate_agents.py` to validate the structure.
6. Reinstall or reload the skill bundle in your coding agent so the updated folder is available.

### Marketplace

The `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file lists skills with human-readable descriptions for the plugin marketplace. The CI validates that skill names and paths match between `SKILL.md` files and `marketplace.json`, but descriptions are maintained separately: `SKILL.md` descriptions guide when Claude activates the skill, while marketplace descriptions are written for humans browsing available skills.

- Browse the latest instructions, scripts, and templates directly at [huggingface/skills](https://github.com/huggingface/skills).
- Review Hugging Face documentation for the specific libraries or workflows you reference inside each skill.
